                <h2>3. What Legal Bases Do We Rely On To Process Your Information?</h2>
                <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</p>

                <h3>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</h3>
                <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Analyse how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
                            <li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>
                            <li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</h3>
                <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

                <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
                    <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
                    <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
                    <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
                    <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
                    <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
                    <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
                    <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
                    <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
                    <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
                    <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We may disclose de-identified information for approved research or statistics projects, subject to ethics oversight and confidentiality commitments</p>

                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                <h2>8. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>
                <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>

                <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.</p>

                <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

                <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>

                <p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>

                <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.</p>

                <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

                <p><strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>

                <h3>Account Information</h3>
                <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>

                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

                <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>

                <h3>Will your information be shared with anyone else?</h3>
                <p>We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written contract between us and each service provider.</p>

                <p>We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be 'selling' of your personal information.</p>

                <p>We have not sold or shared any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months.</p>

                <h3>Your Rights</h3>
                <p>You have rights under certain US state data protection laws. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law. These rights include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Right to know whether or not we are processing your personal data</li>
                    <li>Right to access your personal data</li>
                    <li>Right to correct inaccuracies in your personal data</li>
                    <li>Right to request the deletion of your personal data</li>
                    <li>Right to obtain a copy of the personal data you previously shared with us</li>
                    <li>Right to non-discrimination for exercising your rights</li>
                    <li>Right to opt out of the processing of your personal data if it is used for targeted advertising (or sharing as defined under California's privacy law), the sale of personal data, or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects ('profiling')</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
                <p>To exercise these rights, you can contact us by submitting a data subject access request, by emailing us at <a href="mailto:elliott@verbi.pro">elliott@verbi.pro</a>, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.</p>

                <p>Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an authorised agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorised agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorised to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

                <h3>Request Verification</h3>
                <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.</p>

                <p>If you submit the request through an authorised agent, we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity before processing your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.</p>

                <h3>Appeals</h3>
                <p>Under certain US state data protection laws, if we decline to take action regarding your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing us at <a href="mailto:elliott@verbi.pro">elliott@verbi.pro</a>. We will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If your appeal is denied, you may submit a complaint to your state attorney general.</p>

                <h3>California 'Shine The Light' Law</h3>
                <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the 'Shine The Light' law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?'</p>
